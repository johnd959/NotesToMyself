## Acknowledgements

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Icons from the [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) module are used, including the [Font Awesome](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons/fa/), [Font Awesome 6](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons/fa6/), and VS Code[](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons/vsc/) libraries.

## Privacy/Security

The SSO (log in with Google/Github) functionality is provided through Firebase Authentication. Your email provided through SSO or creating an account is used for the express purposes of creating an account, establishing a method for logging-in, and recovering your lost password. Although the system is believed to be stable and secure, the longevity of the notes stored on NotesToMyself cannot be guaranteed.
